Debugging is the life of any developper. It allows you to check when your code doesn't behave... because you gave it the wrong instructions.

Let's dive into how to enable it in Visual Studio Code. It will be quick.

## Pre-requisites

- Have a NodeJS-enabled project (for that was [this one](https://github.com/JeremieLitzler/iamjeremie.me)).
- Have Visual Studio Code installed.

## How to enable debugging

It can be found of the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_javascript-debug-terminal).

### Step 1

### Step 2

Run the command to run your application, in my case:

```sh
npm run dev
```
